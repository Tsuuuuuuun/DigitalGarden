[if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail - Wiktionary, the free dictionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_all_you_have_is_a_hammer,_everything_looks_like_a_nail)

どうやらマズローが由来らしい。

> _I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail._

~~最近では生成AIまわりの話がかなりこれになってきている（自戒を込めて）~~
